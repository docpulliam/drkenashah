                <h4>Ever wondered what its like to be an Allergy & Immunology specialist or what it takes? Dr. Kena Shah, an Allergy & Immunology specialist, shares the inside scoop in our latest Q & A.</h4>

                <h4>What is your title?</h4>
                <p>Allergy & Immunology Specialist</p>

                <h4>What is your field?</h4>
                <p>Allergy, Asthma, Immunology, Internal Medicine, Public Health</p>

                <h4>How did you decide to go into your field?</h4>
                <p> There are many reasons why I like the field of allergy & Immunology: </p>

                <p>1. It provides diversity in the acuity of illnesses in patients.</p>
                <p> 2. I can see both adults and pediatric patients.</p>
                <p> 3. I can follow individual patients throughout their life and also provide care for their family members of all ages.</p>
                <p>4. I wanted to work more in an office setting while still being able to do consultations in the hospital.</p>
                <p> 5. I wanted a good lifestyle.</p>
                <h4> How many years did you study and train? Where did you go to school and train?</h4>
                <p>I studied for 12 years after high school. 3 years of undergraduate, 4 years of medical school, 3 years of internal medicine residency, and 2 years of allergy and immunology fellowship. I did my undergraduate at the University of
                  North Carolina at Charlotte. Medical school at Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine – GA campus. Residency at the Jefferson Health of New Jersey. Fellowship at Nova Southeastern University.
                </p>

                <h4>What are some things you enjoy about your chosen field?</h4>
                <p>I like the diversity in my patient population. By sub-specializing in allergy, I see common diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, angioedema, and food allergies – this helps me improve the
                  “quality of life” of patients. While the subspecialty of immunology, offers me the opportunity to see rare and potentially life threatening disorders of the immune system – this makes me feel like I am actually “saving” lives and
                  making a difference. So, this field provides me a perfect balance.</p>


                <h4>What are somethings you wish were different about your chosen field? What are some of the challenges you face within your field? Were there obstacles you had to overcome?</h4>
                <p>1. There have been a lot of other specialties who now do allergy testing just because it is very lucrative. The biggest challenge allergists face is dissuading these patients when they are given an incorrect diagnosis from other
                  specialties who perform allergy testing.</p>
                <p>2. Charting – I wish I had to chart less, so I could get more face time with my patients.</p>


                <h4>What is your lifestyle like? What are your hours like? Do you take call?</h4>
                <p>I have a very balanced lifestyle – I don’t work weekends, nights or holidays. I have a fairly flexible schedule during the week days as well so I can be present for my family when needed.</p>


                <h4>What advice would you give to women considering pursuing a career in your field? Would you recommend your field to them?</h4>
                <p>I would start by asking yourself the following questions –</p>

                <p>1. Do you want to see kids or adults? (Internal medicine vs pediatrics)</p>
                <p>2. Do you want to work primarily in a hospital setting or clinic?</p>
                <p>3. Are you more of a hands-on person or visual (surgery vs dermatology)?</p>
                <p>4. Do you like to see a variety in your patient population or would you rather be in a specialized field and see comparatively less variety? (primary care vs specialty medicine).</p>
                <p> 5. Are you okay working nights/weekends? (ER/ICU/hospitalists vs rheumatology/PM&R/dermatology/allergy Immunology/ophthalmology).</p>

                <p>To answer your question about whether I would recommend the field of allergy & immunology – Absolutely yes, I love my field and If I had to do it all over again, I would pick this field once again.</p>


                <h4>Is there anything else you would like to share with readers about your field?</h4>
                <p> It’s an amazing field. And like, I said above, I would do it all over again if I had to. If any of you prospective students and residents are interested in knowing more about the field, feel free to contact me!</p>

                <h4>Finding the right gift for women who are doctors can be a daunting task. The authors of “The Chronicles of Women in White Coats” can help with this sometimes grueling process. Here are some suggestions for gifts that your special
                  person will love.</h4>

                <h5>TOTE BAG</h5>
                <p> “At the beginning and end of my shift, I can go into my tote and find exactly what I need. Whether it be my comb or my reliable water bottle, I always have my must-haves at my fingertips. The perfect tote has both pockets on the
                  inside and outside. The more storage area the better!”

                  -Amber Robins, MD, MBA Family Physician</p>

                <h5>MEDELITA SCRUBS</h5>
                <p>“If you are looking for the perfect set of scrubs, my advice is to choose a scrub set which is good quality and feels comfortable all day. Some of my friends recently tried…Medelita scrubs and swear by them. As long as they are
                  comfortable, the right fit and are easy to ‘just pull it on’ I think it seals the deal and serves the purpose.”</p>

                <p>-Surabhi Batra, MD, Pediatric Hematologist Oncologist and Stem Cell Transplant Doctor</p>

                <p> “I really love the fit of the Medelita Argon Scrub pants.The fit is very flattering and the material is really durable and stain resistant.”</p>

                <p>-Archana Shrestha, MD, Emergency Medicine Physician</p>

                <h5>GROCERY DELIVERY SUBSCRIPTIONS</h5>
                <p>“Grocery delivery service subscriptions such as Instacart & Shipt are convenient and have saved me so much time. Choosing items for meal prep/planning and comparison shopping can be done on the app. The only disadvantages are
                  trusting someone else to choose your produce and not being able to use as many coupons as you would shopping in the store. However, the time saved is well-worth it.”</p>

                <p>-Danielle Johnson, MD, Psychiatrist</p>

                <h5>HAIR PRODUCTS</h5>
                <p>“After being in the medical field with many long days and long nights, I have never had much time to give the right amount of attention to my hair. However, since I found this amazing line of products which I absolutely love,
                  taking
                  care of hair has not just been easy but super fun.”</p>

                <p>-Surabhi Batra, MD, Pediatric Hematologist Oncologist and Stem Cell Transplant Doctor</p>

                <p>“This unique hair care line takes an entirely new approach to over processed and chemical damaged hair and heals the hair from the inside out.”</p>

                <p>-Angela Freehill-Brown, MD, Orthopedic Surgeon</p>

                <h5>CUSTOMIZED TUMBLER</h5>
                <p>“Add a little sparkle to your favorite doctor’s cup of coffee. An insulated tumbler will keep beverages warm for hours. Since it will be personalized with her name, it won’t get lost among all those other coffee cups at the office
                  or
                  hospital!”</p>

                <p>-Alexandra Pinon, MD, Pediatrician</p>

                <h5>BUSINESS CARD HOLDERS</h5>
                <p>Going into your bag and taking out a beautifully designed business card holder can put some style into the way a doctor does her business. A business card holder can be an even more trendy gift if personalized.</p>

                <p>“These are really great for gifting. Very stylish, well made and useful!!”</p>

                <p>-Surahbhi Batra, MD, Pediatric Hematologist Oncologist and Stem Cell Transplant Doctor</p>

                <h5>APPLE WATCH</h5>
                <p>Having a watch is an essential tool for any doctor. Whether it be for telling the time or using it for calculating heart rate, it can help save time and save lives.</p>

                <p>“I can see my notifications quickly in exam rooms in case of emergencies. It also helps me track my fitness goals.”</p>

                <p>-Kena Shah, DO, Adult & Pediatric Allergy & Immunology Doctor</p>

                <h5>GIFT CARDS</h5>
                <p>Don’t know what quite to get? You can never go wrong with a gift card from stores like Medelita or even Starbucks. These can be the best go-to gifts for last minute shoppers. It will give your woman in a white coat the ability to
                  choose exactly what she likes the most.</p>

                <h5>ESSENTIAL OILS</h5>
                <p>“Peppermint essential oil is my favorite. This really helps me when I’m stressed out on rounds. I apply to my temples and wrists and breathe deeply. Great adjuvant in conjunction with many other things for a moment of mindfulness
                  and
                  stress relief.”</p>

                <p>-Bande Virgil, MD, Pediatric Hospitalist</p>

                <h5>MEDELITA WHITE COAT</h5>
                <p>Designed by a female clinician, Medelita white coats live up to their reputation of superior quality and fit. These lab coats are made of a fluid repellent, bacteriostatic performance fabric and are available in 6 different styles
                  that come in either Classic Fit, Slim Fit, or Petite Fit.</p>

                <p>“I never thought it would be possible to have a tailored white coat that is both stylish and comfortable. Medelita’s M3 Vera G. Slim Fit Lab Coat is the perfect fit for me in every way.”</p>

                <p>-Amber Robins, MD, MBA, Family Medicine Physician</p>

                <h5>EXERCISE PROGRAM MEMBERSHIP</h5>
                <p>Some doctors may need an extra push to drop extra pounds. Purchasing exercise programs for them may help give them an additional incentive.</p>

                <p>“Programs like Beachbody On Demand would help save women doctors a lot of time and money for working out. And since doctors often work odd hours, these online workouts can be done from the convenience of home or even a call room
                  at
                  any time. And the best part is that Beachbody programs totally work and deliver results. ”</p>

                <p>-Archana Shrestha, MD, Emergency Medicine Physician</p>

                <h5>BOOKS</h5>
                <p>Even after reading dozens of books from medical school to taking their boards, some still love reading a good book in their down time. The Women in White Coats blog has published a list of 12 books they suggest would make
                  excellent
                  gifts for your someone special.</p>

                <p>Also, you should check out our book “The Chronicles of Women in White Coats” where you can learn more about our stories of burnout, choosing the right speciality in medical or dental school, dealing with stress at work or at home,
                  becoming a mother, supporting a friend, and so much more!</p>
